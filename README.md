This is an application that allows users to create deposits and receive interest payments on them.

Main functionality:

Create Deposit: Users can create new deposits by specifying the amount and currency they wish to deposit.

Approve Deposit: A bank employee can approve the created deposit and initiate the operation to deduct funds from the client's account.

Decline Deposit: In case of unsuitable conditions or limitations, a bank employee can decline the deposit and notify the client of this decision.

Complete Deposit: Upon the expiration of the specified time period, the deposit will be completed, and the deposited amount along with the accumulated interest will be returned to the client. The client will also receive a notification of the deposit completion.
